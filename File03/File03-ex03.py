# Create a function "f" that takes an input "N",
#     and count how many numbers from 1 to N (both inclusive)
#     that are either divisible by 3 OR divisible by 5
# The list of numbers include:
#     3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27
# And so,
#     if N=9, then there are 4 such numbers (3,5,6,9)
#     if N=15, then there are 7 such numbers (3,5,6,9,10,12,15)

def f(N):
    # ...............
    # ...............
    return 100

result1 = f(3)
print(result1)

result2 = f(4)
print(result2)

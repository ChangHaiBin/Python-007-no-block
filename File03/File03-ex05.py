# Create the is_prime function, that checks whether a number is a prime number or not.

# Hint: A prime number is a number N that can only be divided by 1 and N without any remainder.
# i.e.: From 1 to N, the list of divisors of N has a length "len" of 2


# The list of prime numbers include:
# 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,......
#
# So your function should return True if N is equal to any of the prime numbers above (and False otherwise)


def is_prime(N):
    # .................
    return True


for N in range(1,100):
    if is_prime(N):
        print(N)

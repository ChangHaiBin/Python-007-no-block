# Create a function "f" that takes in two numbers "x", "y",
# And find the distance between those two numbers.
# The distance must be a positive number or zero.
#
# Two methods:
# 1. Split into two cases, x > y, and x <= y
# 2. Use Python's "abs" absolute value function.

def f(x, y):
    # .................
    return 1000


print(f(3, 10))    # Answer: 7
print(f(20, 11))   # Answer: 9
print(f(40, 40))   # Answer: 0
